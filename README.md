Credit Card Risk Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and modeling credit card transactions to detect potential risks and fraudulent activities. Using a real-world dataset and applying machine learning techniques, the aim is to identify suspicious transactions while minimizing false positives.

📊 Dataset

File: creditcard.csv

The dataset contains anonymized credit card transaction details.

Features are numerical and transformed using PCA (due to confidentiality).

Target variable:

0 → Legitimate transaction

1 → Fraudulent transaction

⚠️ Note: The dataset is highly imbalanced (fraud cases are very rare compared to legitimate ones).

🔑 Key Steps in the Notebook

Data Exploration

Distribution of classes

Correlation between features

Identifying imbalance issues

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values (if any)

Feature scaling/normalization

Train-test split

Modeling & Evaluation

Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.

Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

Special focus on Recall and Precision-Recall tradeoff due to class imbalance

Results & Insights

Models compared based on performance

Recommendations for improving fraud detection systems
